The BottenLab is *officially* in business! I (Dr. Bottenhorn) started as an assistant professor at FIU last month and am now recruiting grad students through [FIU's Cognitive Neuroscience PhD program](https://case.fiu.edu/psychology/phd-in-cognitive-neuroscience/index.html). Applications are due December 1st, 2025 for a Fall 2026 start.

We're launching a precision neuroimaging study of puberty in the very near future, to study individual-level trajectories of pubertal neuroendocrine development. This will include collecting and processing functional, structural, and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data; using longitudinal models to understand brain-hormone associations over time; and applying previously developed machine learning models to understand within- and between-individual differences in pubertal neuroendocrine plasticity.

Other projects in the lab use existing data from the [Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study (ABCD Study)](https://docs.abcdstudy.org/latest/study/), the [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org/), and the [DIVA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.16.589598v1) study to study individual differences in the brain related to various endocrine and environmental factors.

If you're interested, please email your CV and a short blurb about why you'd like to join us to bottenlab@gmail.com.
