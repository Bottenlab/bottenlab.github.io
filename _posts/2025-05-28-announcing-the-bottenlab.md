title:  Introducing the BottenLab!

excerpt: How does pubertal neuroendocrine plasticity confer vulnerability/resilience to neurotoxic effects of environmental exposure?
---

I'm so pleased to announce that I (Dr. Bottenhorn) will be joining the faculty at Florida International University as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology this August, precisely 10 years after I started my PhD in FIU's Cognitive Neuroscience graduate program! Because I'll formally launch the BottenLab later this summer, I'm be looking to hire a part-time lab manager and a postdoc *and* I'll be recruiting Cognitive Neuroscience graduate students to start Fall 2026. 

The focus of the BottenLab will be on understanding endocrine and environmental influences on early adolescent neurodevelopment, specifically focusing on pubertal hormone changes and pollution exposures. To do so, we'll leverage the unique strengths of population-level and precision neuroimaging dataâ€“using large, diverse, existing datasets like the ABCD Study and deep-/dense-phenotyping approaches for new data collection. Ultimately, we'll bridge the two using predictive modeling and (maybe) meta-analysis. 

But first, I have to move across the country (again). Wish me luck!
