The BottenLab is a housed in the Center for Children and Families and Department of Psychology at 
Florida International University. 
We in the BottenLab are studying adolescent brain development and potentially intersecting roles of 
endocrine and environmental factors therein by applying predictive modeling to human neuroimaging, 
biospecimen, and exposure data.

## Pubertal neuroendocrine development

Funded by an NIH BRAIN Initiative K99/R00, the first arm of this research aims to understand 
pubertal neuroendocrine plasticity by, first, identifying brain regions sensitive to hormone 
changes during puberty and, second, describing the stability of such sensitivity throughout adolescence.

In the not-too-distant future, this work will be accompanied by a dense, longitudinal pilot study 
intended to chart individual-level trajectories of pubertal neuroendocrine development.

## Environmental exposures and the developing brain

The second arm of this work has, so far, focused on individual differences in brain structure and fuction 
related to outdoor air pollution exposures during the transition to adolescence. Future research will 
incorporate other environmental exposures (e.g., water and indoor air pollution) with an emphasis on 
endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

## How does pubertal neuroendocrine plasticity confer vulnerability/resilience to neurotoxic effects of environmental exposure?

Future research will bring together these two arms of research to understand how the hormone changes during 
puberty that alter brain plasticity make teens more or less susceptible to environmental harms (i.e., to 
brain and mental health).
