<strong>Dr. Katherine Bottenhorn</strong> earned her bachelors degrees in Psychology and Chemistry from Auburn University (WDE) followed by a masters and PhD in Psychology from the Cognitive Neuroscience graduate program at Florida International University. Then, she drove across the U.S., from Miami to Los Angeles, to do a postdoc in the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California. Over the years, her research has focused on developing open-source software tools for studying individual differences in large-scale brain networks, deep-phenotyping the adult menstrual cycle, and characterizing individual differences in early adolescent neurodevelopment (e.g., related to outdoor air pollution exposure and puberty). In August 2025, she drove _back_ across the U.S., from Los Angeles to Miami, to start as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Florida International University (truly, full circle) and launch the BottenLab.
