Dr. Bottenhorn earned her bachelors degrees in Psychology and Chemistry from Auburn University (WDE), then her masters and PhD in Psychology from the Cognitive Neuroscience graduate program at Florida International University. During graduate school, her research focused on developing and deploying open-source software tools for studying individual differences in large-scale brain networks, culminating in a deep-phenotyping study of functional network connectivity across the adult menstrual cycle. Then, she drove across the U.S., from Miami to Los Angeles, to do a postdoc in the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, where she switched gears just a bit to study individual differences in early adolescent neurodevelopment related to (a) outdoor air pollution exposure and (b) puberty. In August 2025, she'll drive _back_ across the U.S., from Los Angeles to Miami, to start as an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Florida International University (truly, full circle) and launch the BottenLab.
